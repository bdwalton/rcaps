    <h1>RCaps - Ruby Capabilities</h1>

    <p>Capabilities are a feature in the Linux kernel among others that are
    based on the (now withdrawn) POSIX 1003.1e working draft.  They allow for
    more fine-grained control of a process' abilities (eg: it's not just if
    $uid == 0 anymore).</p>

    <p>This native extension is a wrapper around libcap for Linux, which gives
    you the ability to fetch the current capability set (or start with a fresh
    slate) and modify the set in working memory.  When satisfied, you can then
    ask the kernel to set this working set as the active capability set for the
    process.</p>

    <p>You might find this functionality useful if for example you need to run
    a process that needs the ability to change UID's, but don't want to allow
    it to bind ports below 1024.  By using Capabilties, you could grant
    CAP_SETUID and nothing else, thus protecting youself (somewhat, changing
    UID's is still a powerful privilege) from attack...or more simply,
    minimizing your attack surface.</p>
